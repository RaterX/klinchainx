"If you dey educated, dem no go fit deceive you anyhow during election."
"You go sabi your right, and you go fit ask question."
Another way to help yourself na mentorship.
Look for person wey sabi that thing wey you wan learn.
"Humble yourself, ask questions, and observe."
"Yes oh, and even if you no fit find mentor physically, read books, watch videos, listen to podcasts."
Anything wey fit open your mind.
"So una dey talk say if person get right mindset, keep learning, and no give up, e go still make am?"
Bros Na so.
"No be today the seed go grow, but if you water am well, e go turn tree."
Just dey consistent.
You get the fire spirit!
I love how you dey enjoy this — make we roll now.
"This time, make we dive into how youths fit use education take create better future for themselves — no be to just dey wait for help."
"My Broda, all these things wey una don talk make sense."
But how person go take start?
"Sometimes, I just dey feel stuck."
"Like, I wan learn, but I no even know where to begin."
My Sista understand you.
I been feel that way before.
But I just start small — one step at a time.
"First na to decide wetin you like, then find way to learn am, even if na YouTube or free class."
"My brother, you fit pick one skill — like graphic design, data entry, baking, or even phone repair."
Dem plenty for internet.
Some even get free certificate.
"No forget say hustle no bad, but hustle with sense na better thing."
"If you dey sell anything, try learn how to market am well."
Learn customer service.
All na part of education.
And always write down wetin you learn.
De Keep record.
"If you sabi write proposal or business plan, one day you fit see opportunity wey go change your life."
"Another thing be say, make youth stop to look down on small start."
You fit start with naira but your brain go add value.
Na small idea dey turn big company tomorrow.
But waiting dey worry most youth be pressure.
Social media dey make everybody feel like dem dey late.
People dey fake life online and e dey confuse person.
My sister you talk truth.
But remember say real life no be Instagram.
Real growth na process.
"Education dey help you focus on long-term, no be just quick money."
"I dey always tell myself say ""slow success better than fast failure."""
"If I dey learn today, I dey invest in tomorrow."
"My pikin, na true."
"For life, na who get sense dey last."
Na why I dey pray make una carry this hunger to learn go far.
Another way to help yourself na mentorship.
Look for person wey sabi that thing wey you wan learn.
"Humble yourself, ask questions, and observe."
"Yes oh, and even if you no fit find mentor physically, read books, watch videos, listen to podcasts."
Anything wey fit open your mind.
"So una dey talk say if person get right mindset, keep learning, and no give up, e go still make am?"
Na so.
"No be today the seed go grow, but if you water am well, e go turn tree."
Just stay consistent.
Na true talk be that!
Everybody no dey reason like that.
You wan make we run?
"No na, I no talk say make una run na."
That one na true.
"Education dey help people vote wisely, no just because of rice or wrapper."
"You sabi say, even relationship dey better with education."
"If you marry person wey dey reason well, una go settle matter maturely."
No be every time fight go start.
Hmmm..you talk well.
And for parenting too.
"Educated parents dey raise children well because dem sabi how to talk to pikin, guide am, and encourage am."
"Make I talk this one — even if person no finish secondary school, make e no stop to learn."
Learning no get age.
"You fit still learn from phone, internet, church, or even workshop."
True talk.
"Me I dey learn carpentry now, and I dey use YouTube join my training."
Education now dey everywhere — just get the interest.
Na mindset matter.
"If you value knowledge, you go always dey grow."
"Even if na small-small, every day na step forward."
"So wetin una go tell pikin wey dey ask, ""Why I go school?"
"I go tell am say, ""School go help you become better person, give you more choice for life, and help you understand the world well."""
"I go add say, ""School no guarantee money, but e guarantee better sense."
"And na better sense dey help person make money and live good life."""
"I go tell the pikin, ""Learn as much as you fit."
"Nobody fit collect your knowledge from you."""
We don yarn well today.
Make we carry this message go give others.
"Education na key, and we suppose dey unlock that door every day."
"If you want a version for drama, debate, or maybe turn am into a short play or speech, I fit help too."
Just let me know!
"Nice one, you don do your own na!"
I like say you dey enjoy the flow.
"Make we run plenty of the discussion, still on why Education Dey Important..."
"This time we go involve a teacher and a young person wey dey confused about school, to make the talk more real and relatable."
Una Good evening o.
I hear una dey talk about school.
"Abeg make I ask — wetin be the use of all this school wey person go, come still dey hustle like person wey no go school?"
"Good question, my pikin."
"But make I ask you, you think say na only money be the reason why person go school?"
Na money we dey find now.
"If school no go guarantee am, wetin be the point?"
"My brother school fit no give you money straight, but e go give you better tools to find the money."
"E dey teach you how to think, plan, and handle things."
"My dear, education dey open your brain."
Make I give you example — you sabi how to write business proposal?
"No, I no Sabi."
"But if you learn that, you fit take idea go look for support."
You fit write to NGO or even government.
That na power wey education dey give you.
I remember when I wan start my catering business.
"Na one small training I attend teach me how to write plan, advertise online, and manage customer."
Now I dey get steady orders.
"Even to use small app to sell something online, na education help."
No be everything be classroom.
"Some na self-learning, but the mindset start from education."
Hmm… so una dey talk say education pass classroom?
"Exactly, na en be that."
"Education na anytime you dey learn new thing wey go better your life even if na tailoring, coding, farming or speaking English well."
No knowledge dey waste.
You fit mix school with handwork.
Some people wey go school still dey drive keke or do photography but dem dey run am like business because dem sabi book.
You don notice say even YouTube wey people dey learn from na people wey sabi something dey teach there.
"If you no get small sense, how you go even understand wetin dem dey talk?"
E be like say I dey see am small small now.
"So even if I no get money reach to go university, I fit still learn something?"
Yes oh!
Education dey for everywhere now.
Na to get interest and no give up.
Start with wetin you fit.
Even adult school or free online course fit help.
"If you sabi one thing well, combine am with book knowledge,"
Na so e suppose be.
"Okay, I go try."
I go start with learning better English and small computer training.
"From there, I fit build up."
"Correct, you too sabi"
Na so e suppose be!
I dey feel the vibe — you dey enjoy the groove and e sweet me say you want more.
Make we run Especially for our country wey still dey struggle with bad system.
"My children, I dey happy say una dey talk this thing."
"But truth be say, education don cost now."
How poor person go fit train pikin?
Na true talk.
Some schools dey collect too much money.
"Even public school wey suppose cheap, dem still dey ask for different charges."
Na government suppose do better.
"If dem fit provide free and quality education, people go benefit well."
And make dem train teachers well too.
"Some teachers no dey serious, and some no even get passion for teaching."
"Hmm… Tunde, you dey right."
"As teacher, I know say some of my colleagues just dey teach because no other job."
"But if government pay teachers well and provide better training, dem go work with heart."
"Another wahala na say some schools no get materials — no books, no lab, no toilet sef!"
I go talk say community too suppose help.
"If we wait for government alone, we go wait tire."
"We fit come together do small repairs, donate books, or even start after-school lesson for children."
E good say una dey think like this.
"In our time, we dey do community cleaning for school and support the teachers."
Now everybody just face their phone.
Speaking of phone — technology suppose help education now.
But some children no get access to laptop or internet.
E no go too hard if government and big companies fit donate tablets to public schools.
Even solar system for villages fit help school use small tech.
I hear say some people dey teach children coding inside slum areas.
That kind thing dey sweet me.
Na passion and support dey move am.
"Yes, weytin happen?"
Some NGO dey try well.
But more people suppose join hand.
Education no be government work alone — na all of us.
Make we no forget adult education too.
"Plenty mama and papa no finish school, but if we give dem chance, dem fit still learn."
Tori for anoda day.
"If mama sabi read and write, she fit help her pikin."
And papa fit even use am boost his own business.
I be example.
"I no go school well, but I later learn how to read Bible and count money for market."
E change my life small.
See? I tell you na
Education no get expiry date.
"Any age, any place — person fit still learn something."
"So final point be say, make we all dey support education in our own way."
"Teach, donate, encourage, or just spread awareness."

de value of dat US trade amounts to more dan 10% of dia total annual national income.
American buyers fit reduce demand and e go affect Lesotho economy.
dis na devastating day for us
Im say de whole day im industry colleagues and de goment tok about wetin to do next.
"Although im business, wey Oga Kobeli say dey employ around 2,000 people, fit look for oda markets."
"US dey so significant so ""we no fit just shun de US market"
"We need to do everything wey we fit to bring [am] back""."
"Colette van der Ven, one lawyer wey specialise for international trade, tell BBC say de 50% figure wey Trump impose on Lesotho ""make small sense logically""."
"She describe am as ""ironic"" say US dey punish Lesotho for de success wey dem enjoy under Agoa."
Na de idea say countrys dey take advantage of US becos of trade deficit.
dis na new format about trade wey don make people to reason who dey benefit and who no dey benefit
"oda African countries wey US hit wit extra tariffs include 47% for Madagascar, 40% for Mauritius, 37% for Botswana and 30% for South Africa."
Dem hit Nigerian exports too - at a rate of 14%.
"Kenya, Ghana, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Uganda, Senegal and Liberia dey among those countrys wey exports to US go dey subject to de baseline tariff of 10%. US no dey run a trade deficit wit dis countries."
"Trump say de reciprocal tariffs na ""for countrys wey treat us badly"
"During Wednesday announcement for White House, de Republican president say ""cheaters"" bin dey take advantage of US wey dey ""pillaged"" by foreigners."
"For more dan 50 years, dem dey rip off our taxpayers, but e no go happun again,"" Trump tok."
South Africa dey among de long list of countrys wey dem call
"worst offenders"", dat list also include China, Japan and de European Union."
"Dem now dey face higher US rates - payback for unfair trade policies, Trump tok."
Some bad tings dey go on for South Africa.
"You know, say we dey pay dem billions of dollars, and we cut funding because a lot of bad tins dey happun for South Africa,"
"im tok, bifor im begin name oda countrys."
US-South Africa relation begin get K-leg since Trump presidency start for January.
South Africa biggest export to US na platinum.
wey dem fit comot from de import tax.
But dia second biggest export – wey be cars – dem go hit am hard.
"For statement, South African presidency been condemn de new tariffs as ""punitive""."
"e say e fit ""serve as a barrier to trade and shared prosperity""."
Na now we get ourself
"Trump add 34% to de existing 20% duties on all Chinese imports to US, to make am de highest rate globally."
"In addition, Trump impose 25% tariff for all di cars wey them make outside."
"US dey expected to start to charge dem 10% tariffs on 5 April,"
while de higher duties for certain nations go start on 9 April.
"African countrys like South Africa, Nigeria, and Kenya get long-standing trade relations wit US."
How we go take respond to this issues?
Make we enhance our work for African continent and collabo go dey important
"de tariff rates wey US go impose on wetin Trump call ""liberation day"" for American people big."
and de new tariffs fit significantly affect existing economic ties.
"Annabel Bishop, chief economist for Investec, one South Africa-based banking and investment firm, believe say de impact go dey ""very negative"
But she tell BBC say de tariffs fit increase de current shift for Africa trading practices.
Wetin we go expect to see na greater trade wit de Global South
"wia possible, [dia] e dey likely to see some switching in trade partners."""
de tariffs also come in as many African countrys already dey struggle wit de effects of US foreign aid cuts.
wey dey provide health and humanitarian assistance to vulnerable nations.
Trump announce de aid freeze on im first day for office for January as part of a review on top US goment spending.

No be only Simon Ekpa dey inside dis gbege o.
e also get some oda four pipo wey dey for di alleged terrorism activities and di freezing of assets go affect dem too.
Di big queions still dey about wen dem go carry Simon ekpa go court for trial.
And also if oda amended charges dey.
Dis no be di first time wey Ekpa go dey enta gbege for Finland and even Nigerian goverment too.
"During di 2023 general elections for Nigeria, Finland authorities bin gbab Simon Ekpa sake of di tok tok wey put am for gbege."
Na di Nigerian goverment bin ask make dem check di activities of Ekpa.
becos e bin dey call for a boycott of di general elections for Nigeria dat time.

And wetin be the thing wey them fine?
"I never hear all o, but make we dey listen."
To find out why di Finland goverment bin go afta Simon Ekpa and wetin be in offence for di kontri.
"we follow Ilkka Kopra, wey be im lawyer tok."
Mr Kopra confam say true-true Simon Ekpa dey prison.
but add say na di decision of di Finland court of law to put Ekpa for prison.
Lawyer Kopra say dem neva sabi how long e go dey for di prison as dem dey wait for di trial of Ekpa.
Mr Ekpa dey imprisoned by di decision of the Finnish Court of Law
"We no know yet how long e go stay prison or wen di trial go take place,"" di lawyer tok through email reply."
"Meanwhile, e say dem dey try do everitin within dia power to ensure say e dey free, but e neva clear wen tins go dey sorted."
"According to Kopra, e say im no go fit tok much on di matter but e "" hope to do all to get am free as soon as possible."""
But how soon the matta want dey cleared na we no know.
"The way people dey kpai now ehn,e dey shock me."
E still get anoda kwesion if dem go extradite Simon Ekpa to Nigeria?
"Normally, no sovereign nation dey under obligation to surrender a criminal to anoda nation."
bicos evri sovereign nation get legal authority over pipo wey dey live within dia borders.
"Dis na why bifor extradition go happun, di two nations involved suppose don get extradition agreement between dem."
"Also, di nation wey dey request for di extradition must to get proof say di arrested suspect bin commit di crime for dia territory."
or say di crime affect pipo wey dey live for dia territory.
"Meanwhile, for June 2024, Nigeria Chief of Defence Staff,bin accuse di Finnish goverment say dem dey give Simon Ekpa protection."
and e call di Nigeria goverment to explore diplomatic options to make sure say di secessionist leader dey arrested.
"Now wey, Finland govment don gbab Simon Ekpa, Gusau di tok-tok pesin for di Nigeria Defence react to di arrest."
E say di Chief of Defence Staff dey happy wit Ekpa arrest for Finland.
wit di hope say dis go be a step towards im extradition to Nigeria so dat he go face justice
But wetin be di possibility of di Finnish goment extraditing Ekpa to Nigeria to face trial?
But you sure say dem go send am com Nigeria?
"We never dey too sure,make we dey listen."
"Pipo dey call am ""liquid gold."" Some experts even say na source of ""magical powers"
Scientists agree say breast milk dey provide nutrients and antibodies for babies and e dey essential for dia growth.
But some adults dey bank on dia perceived superfood abilities.
"39-year-old Jameson Ritenour, na father of three, im take im first sip of breast milk wen im partner Melissa bin dey breastfeed."
she bin dey produce extra milk wey she no need.
"I dey put am inside my shakes, even though she bin feel say e dey one kain, Im tell news people."
Jameson bin dey curious about di benefits of breast milk afta im watch YouTube video wia a bodybuilder bin tok about di effects of drinking milk.
But the body builder no talk say na breastmilk na.
"Leave that man,make we share hear wetin happen."
To drink im partner breast milk don become part of Jamesons' patan.
"im dey take two bags a day, each dey about eight ounces."
"I bin dey di best shape of my life, im tell news people."
E bin help me build muscle.
"I bin dey lose weight, wen I also put on about 5% of muscle mass for about eight weeks."
Jameson say Im no fit remember ever falling sick or catching cold while human milk bin dey part of im diet.
I want grow like baby and sleep like baby.
"so I decide say I go also eat like baby,"" Im say. ""I bin feel good and I bin look good."""
Buying online dey risky sha.
Sabi pipo say scientific evidence no dey to suggest say to drink breast milk get any benefits for adult body.
"But leading experts say e fit still dey beneficial, dem point to di anecdotal evidence."
"E get a lot of protein - baby dey grow muscles quick- quick, and of course dat na wetin bodybuilders want."
We just no know di science behind it for now.
"But Dr Bode advise caution for now, sake of di questionable sources wey pipo dey buy human milk on Facebook, Craigslist and Reddit."
"Dis news go sweet most men well, well."
"Bodybuilders dey very much in tune wit dia body, so something fit dey dia."
"But Dr Bode advise caution for now, sake of di questionable sources wey pipo dey buy human milk on Facebook, Craigslist and Reddit."
"Dat milk dem neva test am, den add di health risks,"" Dr Bode. warn pipo."
"E fit be a vector for diseases like HIV or hepatitis."""
Breast milk also dey only as good as di diet and general health of di pesin wey dey produce am.
and e fit be a vector for a number of infections.
"Women most times dey pump for environment wey no dey controlled or sterile, and so di milk fit easily dey contaminated."
"One study for 2015 wey Nationwide Children Hospital for US conduct reveal say out of 101 samples of breast milk wey pipo bin buy online, 75% get harmful pathogens and 10% of di samples bin dey mixed wit cow milk or baby formula."
This one na highest news o.
After Jameson sperate from im partner Melissa im bin no longer get access to di breastmilk im bin store inside freezer.
na wen im decide to start to buy online.
Im say im no dey aware of di risks of di milk to dey contaminated.
I buy am off one random pesin for internet.
"but I do small investigation for Facebook and she look normal,"" Jameson tok. ""So, I decide to take my chances."""
"Di lack of scientific data no be concern for am, becos im say im own experience dey extremely positive."
"Wetin wey dey less positive, im tok, na di stigma im dey face."
Pipo definitely dey use side eye look am.
"becos mentally milk na for babies. But e no dey as weird as pipo think."""
Abeg that thin na somehow behaviour na.
Wia dis foto come from?
Breast milk dey provide nutrients and antibodies for babies.
What about vulnerable babies?
"I no ever tell adults to drink breast milk,""na wetin Dr Meghan Azad, wey dey research how human breast milk dey support infant health talk."
I no think say e go harm dem o.
"Dr Bode say pipo suppose donate excess human milk to babies wey need am, rather dan sell am for profit."
but e fit potentially harm babies wey really need breast milk - like premature babies - and dey struggle to get am.
We no get enough milk to feed di most vulnerable babies.
Breast milk get properties wey fit cure diseases for preterm infants. E fit save lives.
"Dr Azad tok to di fact say if struggling mothers feel say dem fit make money by selling milk to bodybuilders online, dat fit further escalate di growing and risky trend of buying breastmilk for adult consumption."
But Jameson say im no dey feel guilty.
Pipo don accuse me of starving babies.
"But no be like say I dey stand outside hospitals, to ask mums to give me all dia milk!"""
"In fact, im say im don get ova100 women wey don contact am, to try to sell dia extra breast milk."
"Say e get people wey dey beg am to buy, every time."
Human milk na largely one area wey sabi pipo neva too do research.
"For a long time, pipo wey dey fund research no really care about breast milk."
"becos dem see am as an unimportant women's issue,"" na wetin Dr Azad tok."
But dat dey change now.
"Apart from di risks of adult wey dey drink breast milk, some components now dem dey study am as potential treatments for a number of adult conditions."
"This condition include arthritis, heart disease, cancer and irritable bowel syndrome."
"This na new tok tok, wey many never hear o."
"Guy some guys ,go begin turn am to cash out point o."
"That no go too bad o,na to see woman wey go dey bring am."
"Dr Azad dey particularly excited about di potential health benefits of human milk, wey be di prebiotic fibres wey dey inside breast milk."
Dis fibres humans no dey digest am but dem dey used by beneficial gut bacteria to promote a healthy microbiome for babies.
"Researchers dey look whether adults fit use di HMOs to help wit conditions like inflammatory bowel disease,"" na wetin Dr Azad tok."
We know say microbiome dey important for so many aspects of our healt.
"For one study in mice wey dem publish for 2021, Dr Bode find out say one HMO reduce di development of atherosclerosis."
"so if we fit discover new ways to manipulate and improve di gut microbiome, dat fit get all sorts of benefits."
And HMOs from breast milk dey show a lot of promise
dat na di blockage of arteries wey dey lead to heart attack and stroke.
"Human milk components dey remarkably unique,"" na wetin Dr Bode tok."
Na di only tin wey dey developed by humans for humans
"Unlike most pharmaceuticals, wey dey develop am through artificial compounds wey pipo go come put inside dia bodies."
im say human milk compounds dey potentially safer and more effective.
"But while dem hold significant promise, di clinical data still dey scarce."
"If ongoing clinical studies prove successful - wey Dr Bode dey confident about, these compounds fit play a major role to prevent heart attacks and strokes."
Stroke wey dey cause millions of deaths every year.
Imagine say we fit reduce di number of pipo wey dey die from heart attack and stroke by a million.
"E go be ogbonge development, o."
Oya na make we move to anoda tori.
E shock Luisa wen she find out say she get breast cancer o.
"E dey completely unexpected,"" na so di 38 years old mother of two from Brazil tok."
"I bin dey young, healthy, fit and no get any risk factors - dis tin no suppose happun to me."
"I no fit believe am, Cancer dey very far from my reality."""
"Dem diagnose Luisa say e get stage three cancer for March 2024, wey mean say e don already advance."
"She do four and half months of chemotherapy, do surgery to remove some part of her breast, and den radiotherapy."
"Luisa complete her treatment for August, but still need to take medication to prevent cancer from returning."
"Nawa o,how she no use know till e reach stage 3?"
"Na same thing me I go like no o,abi e no dey show?"
"Chemotherapy dey aggressive, but my body hold am well, dis na sake of say I dey active, dey young and resilient body,"" na so she tok."
Den surgery come I still face am.
I happy say I no get to remove di whole breast sha.
Di hardest part na wen I loose my hairs.
"Evertin happen so quick and intensely wen I look inside mirror, fear go catch me, and e affect my pikin dem too"
"Luisa tori no be di only one, but e dey help highlight di trend as e dey grow for world."
"more young adults don dey get diagnosed wit cancer, even wen some no get any family history of di disease."
"Cancer dey more common for older pipo due to biological, environmental and lifestyle factors."
"for example, ageing dey increase cell divisions, wey dey lead to mutation build-up and higher cancer risk."
"Oncologists don already link early cancer diagnosis for younger pipo to wetin dem inherit, like BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations for breast cancer."
"but, more patients, like Luisa, bin no dey show any clear signs say e dey her family."
And e dey strange sey e no show for her family o.
"While she get di cancer already,nawa o."
"One recent study wey BMJ Oncology publish find out say, early stage cancer among adults under 50 across di world increase by 79% between 1990 to 2019."
while cancer related deaths from di same group rise by 28%.
Di study analyze 29 types of cancer across 204 countries.
"Also, one report from Lancet Public Health reveal say di rates of 17 types of cancer don steadily rise across generations for US, particularly among Gen X and di millennials (born between 1965 and 1996)."
"Oda cancers like nasopharyngeal, stomach and colorectal cancer don increase among young adults according to di BMJ oncology report."
This news so don put fear for person body o.
"Naso na, person gats dey careful."
"Researchers dey try identify di causes, even as di Lancet study dey warn say if di growth continue, e go reverse di many many years of progress wey dem don make for cancer prevention."
"So far, dietary factors like diets wey dey high in red meat and sodium and low in fruits and milk - along with alcohol consumption and tobacco use, dey among no suspected culprits according to di BMJ Oncology and Lancet reports"
And obesity dey strongly linked to increased cancer risk o.
"through wetin dem dey call inflammation and hormonal deregulation, according to di World Health Organization."
Di Lancet report note say 10 of di 17 cancers wey dey increase among young pipo for di US dey obesity related.
"E sey including kidney, ovarian, liver, pancreatic, and gallbladder cancers."
Any how sha dis factors no explain all di cases.
Scientists dey also explore oda potential contributors.
Some say na constant exposure to artificial light from devices or street lights dey disrupt di biological clock.
"And sey increase risks for cancers like breast, colon, ovarian and prostrate go dey link to artificial light too."
"Oda studies dey suggest say shift work, wit very long exposure to light for night, fit also lower melatonin levels wey dey promote cancer growth."
"For June 2023, colorectal surgeon Frank Frizelle for New Zealand call for research into di kain tin wey microplastics dey do for bowel cancer."
"Im dey suggest say dem dey damage di protective colonic mucus layer, wey dey similar to putting pinholes inside condom."
"Other researchers don argue say ultra-processed food additives like emulsifiers and colourants, fit drive gut inflammation and DNA damage."
And sey Gut disruptions dey linked not only to colorectal cancer but also to breast and blood cancers according to American Association of Cancer Research.
Antibiotics use go up by about 45% through out di world since 2000 - especially among young kids.
"dis fit be anoda culprit as e dey disrupt di gut microbiome. Na so one group of Italian researchers tok for di 2019 report, as dem say e get link to some cancers."
"Even increasing heights across generations fit get hand for rising cancer rate, na so Malcom Dunlop tok."
"Im be professor of coloproctology for University of Edinburgh, Scotland and co-author of di BMJ Oncology report."
"Humans across di world don dey grow taller… and e get strong connection between height and orishirishi cancers, including colon cancer, for instance."
"E add say link dey between cancer risks to more cells, and exposure to natural growth hormone and larger colon surface area."
And e dey increase opportunities for mutations.
"E say screening younger population for cancer no dey cost effective due to low absolute risks, despite di relative increase in cancer cases."
"According to wetin di US National Cancer Institute (NCI), 80% of cancer cases na for pipo wey dey age 55 and above dem dey see am."
Make God continue to help e people.
Di economy situation for Nigeria don begin make pipo find replacement for food items wey dey too costly.
na wetin come start di cucumber stew trend.
Cucumber stew na meal wey dem prepare wit cucumber fruits afta dem blend am as replacement for tomatoes.
tomatoes wey dem bin dey use make di traditional Nigerian stew don change.
Dis na afta one period wey high cost of tomatoes and pepper begin make citizens dey look for alternatives.
"In di height of di tomatoes scarcity, and as at di time cucumber stew begin dey trend, e bin no dey possible for pipo to prepare di basic tomatoes stew without spending at least 5000 naira and above."
"For market, dat time, about five pieces of tomato bin dey go as high as 1,000 naira o"
"while small basket of tomato bin go up reach 30,000 naira for small basket for di North while di big basket dey cost around 45,000 naira"
Every body begin find anoda way once de price go up.
"I been hear the gist too, that time."

"Wen di cucumber stew begin dey trend for social media, pipo begin dey try am to see how e go be for mouth."
"And me I never try am o,I need try am asap."
But I no sabi cook am.
Wash your cucumber very well and cut am into small sizes
"Put am for inside blender, blend am till e dey smooth small."
"Afta dat, carry sieve to comot excess water wey dey inside di cucumber wey you blend becos too much water go spoil di stew."
"Put your oil for fire make e fry small,any oil you like"
Cut your onion and put inside di hot oil to allow am fry small
"Afta frying small time, add your paste wit pepper and mix am well ontop fire."
Add salt and spices wey dey available to use for stew.
Come add di cucumber wey you blend wey too much water no dey inside
Mix am well ontop fire to allow am mix wit di oda ingredients inside pot
"Add your fish, meat and assorted proteins wey you get"
Mix am small and cova di pot make e cook well
"Afta some minutes, comot am ontop fire and your stew don done to chop."
Di process na like di same way wey dem dey cook normal stew.
But na just di cucumber bin dey different for inside di stew.
"Health benefits of cucumber plenty well,well."
One dey go sha try this stew.
Wia di stew wey you cook?
"normaly, cucumber supposed dey served raw so you go fit enjoy di taste, texture and how e be for mouth including di nutrient wey e go provide for di bodi."
You no need to peel or even cook cucumber bifor you chop am
plenti pipo dey even use cucumber make different meals including salad.
Cucumber get about 96% water and e dey di family of fruit and vegetables.
Cucumbers na good source of vitamin C o.
Cucumber na good source of mineral molybdenum too.
Cucumber na also good source of vitamin A.
"Cucumber also contain nutrients like potassium, manganese, folate, dietary fibre and magnesium."
"Di body of cucumber contain phytosterols, wey fit reduce blood cholesterol."
You no suppose dey peel di back of cucumber.

Tomato dey keep your heart healthy.
Tomatoes dey provide daily potassium and to dey chop food wey dey rich in potassium fit reduce di rate of stroke and heart disease.
"Tomatoes also contain one compound called lycopene, wey dey make am get red colour."
Dat lycopene get nutrient wey fit reduce di risk of cardiovascular disease.

"To dey cook some kain fruits and vegetable fit beta di taste, texture and even di look wey go make am safe to chop but no be all of dem."
Pipo dey blend tomatoes wit dia pepper to make correct stew and na di common and recommended method for some place be dat.
"But to dey cook cucumber wey you suppose chop raw, go reduce di nutrient na."
E go even make di look and taste different from how e suppose be for mouth.
nutritionist explain for news people sey Good Food wey some foods dey beta wen e dey raw dan to cook dem.
Some vitamins dey very sensitive to heat and to cook dem go quickly reduce dia vitamins.
Some fruits wey get vitamins B go quickly lose dat nutrient if dem cook am inside hot water.
Cucumber na one of dat fruits wey fit lose nutrient once e dey heated through fire.
"According to nutritionist Torrens, fruits and vegetables like carrots, brocolli and even tomatoes, fit go through small cooking to make am easier for our bodies to benefit from some of di antioxidants wey fit protect us."
"Wen you cook tomatoes – or make am into suace, e fit help to break down di plant cell walls wey go allow us to beta get di lycopene wey dey inside to benefit di bodi."
All dis nutrients go help save our cells from damage and go fit protect us from some cancers and health diseases.
To get beta nutrient from fruits and vegetables depend on how you prepare am and di kain method wey you use chop am.
Na true say cooking fit make food safer as e go kill some pathogens but you need to know which kain fruits go need cooking.
"As economy fit dey bite hard, e dey important to chop healthy food and vegetables."
"But no be only to chop, but to ensure say na balanced diets wey get enough nutrients you dey chop."
Sabi pipo recommend say balanced diets wey get di six classes of foods na di best for di bodi.
"Everyday new news,na wa o."
"Crude oil price don weak, as e drop more dan 12% reach around $65.50 per barrel."
afta President Donald Trump slam trade tariffs on plenti kontiris.
"Bifor dem announce di tariffs, oil bin dey sell above $70 per barrel."
Na so Nigeria President Bola Tinubu sign di 2025 budget wey fix crude oil price for $75 per barrel.
Dis one mean say Nigeria goverment go need find way cover di $10 gap since crude oil don drop go between $64 and $65 per barrel.
"Plenti Nigerians dey wonder anytime wen crude oil price go up or down, how e go take affect di economy and dia own life."
But I think say them say no subsidy again?
My dear me I no know again o.
"For dis mata, News People interview one expert for Kano, Professor Kabiru Isa Dandago wey be Accounting lecturer for Bayero University Kano."
Prof Dandago tok say di drop go surely affect Nigeria economy.
and Nigerians suppose prepare for wahala from goverment side since dem plan di budget wit crude oil price of around $71 to $75 per barrel.
"E add say ""Nigerians go need bear di gbege wey goverment go face."
Dis na becos Nigeria total revenue go reduce.
"And if revenue reduce, goverment no go fit capture all di tins wey dem wan spend money on."""
Di sabi pesin for economy mata add say dis mean say goverment go need borrow money join to cover di gap.
"Many of di projects wey Nigeria goverment plan to do, dem no go fit do dem again."
"E also tok say di kontris wey US President Donald Trump put tariff on don dey find new buyers for dia crude oil, and dat one go make crude oil full market."
Dis one mean say di kontiri need to borrow again to cover di expenditure gap im talk.
"Wit di tariffs wey President of America put, kontris wey dey sell crude to US now dey find new market."
"And you know say as supply increase, price per unit go reduce"" im add."
Prof Dandago tok say di Nigerian goverment suppose try find new way to sell dia own crude oil instead of to depend on American market alone.
"make dem target kontris wey dey need di crude oil,"" e tok."
Nigeria suppose also dey find way to sell oda tins like mineral resources and dia agriculture products.
"Even if we no make much from crude oil, we fit still make money from selling solid minerals na."
